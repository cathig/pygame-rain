# Rainstorm
Welcome to your personal Rainstorm!

In this exercise from _Python Crash Course_ 2nd Ed (Chapter 12 p. 268), I practiced using pygame to make a steady, random rainfall.

As each raindrop falls off the bottom of the screen, the program randomly sticks it back a little above the game window. The x coordinate is random across the whole game surface, and y is random between the top of the screen and the raindrop's height.

## How to Use
1. Run rain.py.

   A game window with falling rain opens.

2. Enjoy the rain.

3. Close the game window with the Close (X) button or press 'q'.
